        <p><em>The City of London is the ancient centre of our capital city. The old streets stll follow the same mediaeval pattern even though the original shops and houses are (mostly) long gone. Here you can still experience remnants of the earlier city alongside the most modern architecture. This contrast gives The City its unique character and makes it a fascinating place to visit. Come to see a specific attraction such as Tower Bridge or just explore the historic Square Mile. Whilst you are here why not eat, drink and relax in one of the many bars, restaurants and hotels?</em></p>
